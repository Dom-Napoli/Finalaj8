        <h3>Air Jordan VIII Aqua</h3>
        <P>The Air Jordan 8 Retro Aqua 2015 was made available in three major color combinations; black, bright concord, as well as an aqua tone. This 2015 Air Jordan 8 is made of a durabuck upper that is black colored. The sneaker has a design that features anti-inversion cross straps, an AIR sole, an inner sleeve, as well as a polycarbonate torsion plate. This high-top shoe also boasts additional aqua and purple tones at the back end, and the base in an abstract pattern. A lacing system with black laces finishes the overall look.</P>

        <h3>Air Jordan VIII Alt. Bugs Bunny</h3>
        <P>The classic Air Jordan 8 will be treated in Jordan Brand’s alternate iteration in 2017, as this particular pair is reflective of the original Bugs Bunny theme. Essentially a tribute to an unreleased variation which didn’t make it into production when the Bugs Bunny pair released in 1993, the silhouette is dressed in an appealing color scheme of white, black and red. White leather with perforations covers its upper, while contrasting red and black accents are scattered throughout its entirety. A graphic inner liner and “1993” on the pull tabs completes the respective design.</P>

        <h3>Air Jordan VIII - Playoffs</h3>
        <P>The Air Jordan 8 "Playoffs" made its original debut back in 2007 and it was last offered in 2013. Now, the highly-coveted colorway of the classic silhouette will be making a retro appearance in 2023 as it pays homage to the last sneaker that Michael Jordan wore during Game 6 of the 1993 NBA Finals against the Phoenix Suns, which eventually led the Chicago Bulls to their first three-peat NBA Championship as well as Michael Jordan's third straight Finals MVP. The 2023 retro will flaunt the very same "Black/True Red" color scheme as the 2013 retro and essentially stay true to its OG makeup featuring the distinctive graphic overlays on the mudguards and multicolor rubber outsole. Our first look also shows that the shoe will also come with its original Red pull tabs like the OG pair instead of Black that was used on the previous retro.</P>

        <h3>Air Jordan VIII OVO Blk</h3>
        <P>The Air Jordan 8 OVO Black features a full Black premium tumbled leather makeup. Red accents are seen on the Jumpman-branded tongue patch, while OVO branding and owl logos are also applied to the shoe’s pull tab. The Metallic Gold accents on the outsole and heel region provide the shoe with even more of an OVO vibe.</P>

                <h3>Air Jordan VIII - Cool Grey</h3>
                <P>This new colorway of the Air Jordan 8 uses the “Cool Grey” color scheme that was made popular by the Air Jordan 11. The shoe features a Cool Grey and Wolf Grey nubuck/suede upper with tonal detailing on the cross straps, laces, tongue, and even the chenille Jumpman patch on the tongue. The year “1993” has been placed on the heel as a nod to when the Air Jordan 8 originally released.</P>

        <h3>Air Jordan VIII Chrome</h3>
        <P>Noted as the first non-OG variation of the Air Jordan 8, this particular model made its initial debut back in 2003 and certainly garnered too much attention, in correlation with the iconic silhouette and especially its monochromatic palette, therefore listed as an instant classic. Simply described overall, tonal Black dominates the sneaker’s nubuck composition and sole unit, while varying shades of Chrome Grey, White and Black flow along its distinctive rear portion. Rounded out with its signature furry Jumpman logo in its respective palette, alongside its laces and tonal crossover straps embroidered with the number “23″, look for the Air Jordan 8 “Chrome” to arrive at Jordan Brand and Nike stockists on December 19, 2015.</P>
